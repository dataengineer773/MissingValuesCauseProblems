i do to evaluate the Linear Discreminant Analysis(LDA) algorithm on the dataset with missing values, This is an algorithm that does not work when there are missing values in the dataset. The missing values in the dataset
as we did in the previous section, then attempts to evaluate LDA using 3-fold cross-validation and print the mean accuracy.
